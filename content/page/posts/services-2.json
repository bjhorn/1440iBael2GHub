This cost businesses of all types and sizes billions in wasted marketing.  The most common mistake we see is made when creating ads, sales pages and marketing campaigns that try to multitask or multi-prospect more than one product or person at a time. Here is what happens. The business owner or the marketing person sits down and puts together an ad that they think will appeal to multiple people in an attempt to appeal to more than one type of customer/buyer. The thinking is if I broaden my appeal to cover multiple product or multiple services in one ad or campaign I will increase my chances of selling more and reduce the chances of the business wasting money on advertising that does not work. \n\nThis type of marketing message is rarely heard by anyone. If you look at the most successful marketing campaigns, the greatest speeches in history or the best novels or short stories ever written they all rely on one common basic principle.  Do you know what it is? If your stumped your not alone.      \n\n\\"
