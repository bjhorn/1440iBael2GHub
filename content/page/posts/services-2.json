  "body": "## The Taste of the Fish Determines the Bait.\n\n   Billions of dollars are wasted on advertising that misses the mark each year.     Businesses of all types and sizes creating ads, sales pages and email marketing messages that try to appeal to the widest possible audience. The business owner or the marketing person sits down and puts together an ad that they think will appeal to multiple people in order to get more people to buy. The thinking is if I my appeal covers more products and services at one time I increase my chance to sell more and reduce the chances of me wasting money on advertising that does not generate business.
